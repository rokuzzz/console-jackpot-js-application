# **Console Jackpot**

This is a simple slot machine game you can play in the console. It lets you bet money, choose lines to bet on, and spin to win based on symbol combinations.

## Game Idea

You start with some money. You choose how many lines to bet on and how much money to bet. The game has a 3x3 slot machine with different symbols. If the symbols line up, you win more money.

## My Motivation

I built this game to get better at JavaScript. Lately, I've been working a lot with React for big projects and started to forget the basics of JavaScript. Making this game was a way to practice those basics again. It was fun to see what I could do with just JavaScript, without using any big tools or frameworks. I hope this game shows others that you can make cool things with simple JavaScript.

## Start Playing

**Console Jackpot** requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.
